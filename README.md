## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cecilia Ertman, a 30-year-old software developer from Turku. I graduated with an ICT-degree in January of 2025 and applied for an engineering degree right after, grateful to have been accepted on the first try. I've finally found the field I'm truly passionate about, but I do have a whole host of other jobs under my belt. Most notably, I spent many years as an entrepreneur in the car business, both as a detailer and a dealership owner. I've also worked as a laborer at an animal farm and as a personal assistant to the visually impaired, which I still do on the side.
